I have uploaded a ZIP file of an existing full-stack web platform.
Your task is NOT to redesign or refactor, but to understand, restore, and continue the current system exactly as described below.

2️⃣ SHORTS (NEWLY ADDED & MUST WORK)

etc.
Videos are:

🔑 API KEYS REQUIRED (IMPORTANT)
You will find placeholders or environment variables for:
JWT_SECRET
MongoDB URI
YouTube Data API Key
Used in Explore section
Cerebras AI API Key
Used in chatbot
👉 I will manually insert these keys —
DO NOT hardcode them
Use:
.env file
process.env.KEY_NAME
⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES
❌ Do NOT refactor existing logic
❌ Do NOT remove any features
❌ Do NOT redesign UI
❌ Do NOT add filters
✅ Only restore, fix broken connections, and ensure everything works
🎯 FINAL GOAL
After extracting the ZIP:
App should run without crashes
Auth works
Parent & Child roles work
Chat works
Calls work
Explore videos load
Shorts section is visible & playable
Creator uploads appear correctly
If any file reference is missing, infer logically from existing structure, not redesign.
